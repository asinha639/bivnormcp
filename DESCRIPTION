Description: This package implements a Bayesian change point detection algorithm 
    for bivariate normal data, motivated by the need to jointly analyze correlated 
    time series or sequences of observations. It models the sequence of bivariate 
    observations and detects multiple distributional shifts using an online search 
    strategy and probabilistic inference. The method is particularly suited for 
    situations where simultaneous shifts in two correlated variables occur, and 
    includes visualization tools for interpreting the change points. This methodology 
    supports applications in fields such as epidemiology, finance, environmental 
    monitoring, and other domains involving multivariate temporal data.
